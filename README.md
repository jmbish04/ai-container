# AI + Containers = Code execution?

Send a POST request with some text to this worker, and you will automatically execute some code in a container generated by an AI.

## Apps Script Development

This container has been updated to include Node.js and the Google `clasp` CLI for
managing Apps Script projects. `clasp` can be used to pull and push Apps Script
code, making it easier to integrate with the Cloudflare worker defined in this
repository.

### Example workflow

1. Authenticate with your Google account inside the container:

   ```bash
   clasp login --no-localhost
   ```

2. Clone or create your Apps Script project:

   ```bash
   clasp create --type standalone
   ```

3. Deploy or update Apps Script code with Cloudflare workers as needed.
